# CryptoWrap

CryptoWrap is a payment gateway/processor architected for secure, reliable, and seamless cryptocurrency transactions.
Providing a unified interface for both inbound and outbound payments. The project prioritizes simplicity and ease of integration, offering a lightweight and fast solution that operates as an extensible wrapper (API layer) for various blockchains.

### Coins
- Monero 🪙
- Litecoin (planned, not yet implemented) 🚧

#### Features
- HTML page (customizable template) for accepting crypto payments in 3 different modes:
1. WebSocket (fastest, default)
<br> 🚧 Under construction:
2. HTTPS polling (more reliable for unstable connections, fallback) 🚧
3. No-JavaScript 🚧

- Accept, store and send coins via isolated `virtual` accounts. <br>
For systems with multiple users, where funds must be safely separated and managed.
